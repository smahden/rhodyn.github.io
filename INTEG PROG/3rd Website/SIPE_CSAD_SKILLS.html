	My skills include building and basic troubleshooting and fixing computers. This was developed mostly because my dad knows and likes to fix things at home so I tried learning the things he did. Also, I found one of my subjects during JHS, Electronics in particular, to be enjoyable. We learned many things there, from how to diagnose electronics to fixing some appliances. In the end, most of my experience came from trial and error. I am also good with math and partly science, with having participated in multiple math events throughout my school life and achieving respectable awards. While I cannot say that I am good at math now given my recent grades on it, it is mostly due to my negligence in studying the subject - my ego, should I say. And lastly, what started as a hobby turned out to be the most known skill my friends say to me and that is - dancing. I never labeled myself as a professional but according to others, on top of being a part of winning dance groups, I guess I could consider myself proficient at it. I don’t have the biggest variety when it comes to my skills but I try to learn different things as I go in life. </blockquote></p>

	My hobbies include reading web novels and comic books, mostly from Japanese and Korean authors. I wouldn’t call myself a fan but I like the culture of Japan and Korea. Learning through their media like shows and books is my way of supporting what’s theirs. This also gives me a chance to learn a little bit of their language which doesn’t translate to any skill as I haven’t been able to apply them in any case. I also like listening to music when I’m able to. I don’t have any specific genre that I lean towards but I always have a couple artists to fall back on when I’m not feeling well. Artists like Keshi, whose songs are very chill and would sometimes be my music before going to bed. Previously, I loved dancing while listening to music but life happened and I slowly lost interest with dancing. Back to the positive side, I also play computer games on the weekends and like every “gamer,” I also went through the phase of thinking I had the skill to go professional in gaming. Lastly, my most recent hobby is working out. Working out is probably the hobby I am most thankful of picking up as it makes me feel good about myself. </blockquote></p>

	I am a really huge fan of computers, their hardware specifically, and this is part of the reason why I chose my college course. I love knowing about each component, their detailed specifications, and how they go well in making a whole computer build. Unfortunately, I do not have the capability to be building computers as it is a fairly expensive field of interest. I also find writing very appealing. Since I picked up reading novels as a hobby, I’ve come to find myself analyzing stories and trying to guess the flow of future occurrences. Although I haven’t tried making my own, I would love to discuss my views on certain stories with other people. Playing instruments, specifically the piano, is also one that I’ve always wanted to try. There’s something about pianists that just mesmerizes me when they perform; maybe it’s that aura of “elegance” that pulls me in on their act. This last one is somewhat of a niche and not really common for the older generations but I consider myself invested in certain computer games and their community. I find myself taking the game seriously and really learning the ins and outs of it. I probably have more interests considering that most of these coincide with my hobbies and partly my talents but I chose only these because I find them the most definitive of what I really love to do. </blockquote></p>
