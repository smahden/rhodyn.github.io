	Born in the small town of Olongapo, Zambales, childhood life was the usual for a non-city kid<sup>1</sup>. We lived in a fairly spacious house with my grandparents and a few of my cousins<sup>2</sup>. My grandma would always tell the story on how lively it was back then when everyone was still living in the house but sadly, with the passing of our grandparents, everyone slowly moved away<sup>3</sup>. Gloomy stories aside, quite a number of my most memorable moments are from my childhood<sup>4</sup>. My cousins and I had around a year gap per child, meaning if I was 6, one of them was 7, the next was 8, and so on<sup>5</sup>... This meant that we didn't really feel that age gap and we could all relate to each other, making everyone included in our games and stuff<sup>6</sup>. We went to the same pre-school, walked to school and back together, played the same games when we got home, liked the same movies; we really were like actual brothers and sisters<sup>7</sup>. This was also the time were I got very active in trying out different activities<sup>8</sup>. I tried different sports like basketball and volleyball, but the one that really stuck with me was badminton<sup>9</sup>. In addition, my parents also urged me to pick up more skills and/or hobbies along the way <sup>10</sup>. The next one I learned was swimming, although this one didn't really last long due to my health conditions <sup>11</sup>. Also, I tried joining every activity there is on school - be it a drawing or painting contest and even the choir tryouts when I could barely sing <sup>12</sup>. On top of my extracurricular activities, I was also very participative when it comes to my lessons <sup>13</sup>. I was consistenly on the Top 5, rarely going below the Top 3 for my whole 6 years there <sup>14</sup>. Due to this, I was always part of the representatives with Math contests and sometimes Science too <sup>15</sup>. I was also a part of the Math club as I thought it would give me more math things to do but we ended up doing nothing at all <sup>16</sup>. I was also a part of the journalism club but I wasn't very proficient at it, but I was decent at the photography part of the club <sup>17</sup>. My childhood years is what I consider the time frame that really built my "ego" when it came to school performance <sup>18</sup>. Back then, there was never a compromise and I was always hunting for that first place <sup>19</sup>. Being from a private school, their approach to teaching is definitely more on the spoonfeed style but this was something I couldn't have known back then, and this was also the reason why everything came crashing once I grew up <sup>20</sup>.</p>

	<p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Teenager years is when life really started hitting me back<sup>1</sup>. I mentioned studying at a private school so transferring to a public school for junior high gave me a surprising shift in school life<sup>2</sup>. The school I went to, even though they're the most known Science High School in our area, was also known for its rowdy students <sup>3</sup>. It was a mostly a safe experience in school but there's always this worry that you might get caught up in something <sup>4</sup>. Unfortunately, most of my bad habits came from when I studied there <sup>5</sup>. To start it off, my grades went from averaging 97-96 to bare 90s and getting my first line of 8 on a subject <sup>6</sup>. The more I think about it, the more I wonder how embarassing it should've been, but past me really thought it was okay to laze around with my studies <sup>7</sup>. Luckily or should I say unluckily, I wasn't reprimanded by my parents because I didn't really fail school <sup>8</sup>. The mindset that my classmates had really affected me badly since most of them were happy-go-lucky with their studies and instead likes to go out and stroll in malls <sup>9</sup>. This was also the time where I got hooked to playing in internet cafes after school <sup>10</sup>. Although I never really skipped class, or at least not yet at this part of the story, I was starting to focus on the wrong things <sup>11</sup>. Going back, I would spend my time sleeping at lunch and chatting with my seatmates during lectures <sup>12</sup>. Nothing new for the average Gen Z teenager but even at home, I just chat with my friends and/or play games <sup>13</sup>. I also stopped participating in the sports I've tried before as it felt like a chore to do <sup>14</sup>. Grade 9 and 10 was when I was starting to realize my mistakes and started to at least pay the slightest attention to my studies - enough to move up as an honor student <sup>15</sup>. These last 2 years of my junior high also blessed me with a couple of my most genuine friends who taught me a lot with dealing different things in life <sup>16</sup>. Senior high school was arguably my most enjoyed school life, having left for Manila to chase something I want for once and being exposed an entirely different place with unique minded individuals <sup>17</sup>. Most of my years were filled with good memories and I went back from being lazy to at least doing a decent job with regards to my studies, achieving high grades at some subjects and consistently being an honor student <sup>18</sup>. I started to improve on myself and I started to care for my future <sup>19</sup>. Most of what I wanted to do in the future was laid out in front and me and my friends planned a lot of things to do in the coming years but sadly, COVID happened <sup>20</sup>.</p>

	<p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	College years is what I'd consider my lowest point in life <sup>1</sup>. From being someone who had planned most of the next few years to having to having to stop going to school and having lost direction in what path I'd like to take from here on <sup>2</sup>. The start of 2020 was very confusing for me and my parents as no one really knew how long the pandemic and the lockdown would last <sup>3</sup>. This meant that we were taking a huge risk if we ever decided to not enroll for the first year as universities surely aren't ready for an entirely online-based school year <sup>4</sup>. Regardless, we chose to push through and bought the necessary equipment to attend classes, which costs us more than we liked, a topic reserved for later <sup>5</sup>. Honestly, online classes was very rough for me as I consider myself someone who cannot focus at a home setting <sup>6</sup>. If even at school, I get distracted, the result of online class was quite a mess for me <sup>7</sup>. I had to go back to all my lessons once the lectures end as I could only keep up with portions of them <sup>8</sup>. But regardless, I was able to achieve okay grades, having most if not all on the 1.25 - 1.75 range <sup>9</sup>. The lessons itself were interesting since this course was still my top pick for college but how long the lessons stayed was an entirely different topic <sup>10</sup>. Second semester came and I already forgot most of what I learned during the first half of the year <sup>11</sup>. It was honestly very disheartening as I thought I wasn't living up to what I was able to do just a year before but still, I tried to push through <sup>12</sup>. After what felt like a long struggle, I luckily passed my first year of online classes <sup>13</sup>. My grades weren't the best, having a 3 in math which was once my best subject but still, I get to study for another year, or at least that's what I thought <sup>14</sup>. Life happened and my mother had a medical case which caused us to allocate almost all of our budget to her recovery <sup>15</sup>. This meant that not a single Peso would be left for my tuition fee, even if paid in installment <sup>16</sup>. They couldn't make a decision but I urged them to let me stop for 1 year, maybe figure things out for myself as I felt that I was getting lost in everything that's happening <sup>17</sup>. In that 1 year, honestly, everything just got worse - my self-esteem went rock bottom, I was losing trust in what I was capable of, I was losing interest in the things I loved to do, but everyone around me continued to live on <sup>18</sup>. Still, the world doesn't stop for my problems so I still went ahead and was able to enroll the next year, being a returnee for the first time <sup>19</sup>. Up until now, I still have all these doubts weighing on me but I try my best to not let it show, at the end of the day, I have to act my role in this world as the show goes on <sup>20</sup>.</p>
